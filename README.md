# zenvaResponsiveWebDesign

These files are part of the zenva responsive websites course. 
In it we create a portfolio website, where we showcase responsive images. 

We also have a folder that contains css-grid exercises and a website made responsive by the grid method. 

Lastly there's a responsive form that showcases the ability to create responsive forms on css.
